# Vue Assets

I use this project to develop and publish my `vue-assets` npm package.

This project is NOT open-source and is the intellectual property of Aaron DeLoach. The source code is provided solely for educational purposes and to accept minor fixes for errors.

The project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and the [Backstack API](https://backstack.com).
